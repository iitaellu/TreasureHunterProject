# TreasureHunterProject
Created with CodeSandbox

## Introduction
As course project I created simple platform game from week 7 exercise. Main idea of game is to collect all stars, survive all three levels and find treasure.  


## What was done
## What tools were used: 

I used codeSandbox, Phaser, Freesound, Pixlr X and web as my tools. 

I used CodeSandbox as my developing environment and in the dependencies, I included phaser. With phaser’s feature I managed to build this simple game. Also, with Phaser’s websites I were able to find some tutorials how to make some features to my game and some images to use my game. From Freesound I found my game audios and with Pixlr X I edit some of my game images. 

Also, internet was very important tool with this project. From there I looked in some examples and ideas how to implement my game’s features in practise. I have list all my sources top of my “index.js” -file.
